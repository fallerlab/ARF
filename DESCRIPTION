Description: ARF is a platform that consists of multiple methods for the analysis of rRNA fragments coming from Ribo-seq experiments. It currently contains the following methods; dripARF. dripARF predicts which Ribosomal Proteins contribute the differential ribosomal hetegeneity across samples by overlapping rRNA fragment data with the 3D structure of the ribosome.
