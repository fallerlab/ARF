Description: ARF is a platform that consists multiple methods for the analysis of rRNA fragments coming from Ribo-seq experiments. It contains the following methods; dripARF. dripARF predicts which Ribosomal Proteins contribute the differential ribosomal hetegeneity across samples by overlapping rRNA fragment data with the 3D structure of the ribosome
