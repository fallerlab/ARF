## ARF
R package for the **<u>A</u>**nalysis of **<u>R</u>**ibosomal RNA **<u>F</u>**ragments, generally generated by Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-Seq) experiments

Currently includes: 

* **dripARF**, ribosome heterogeneity detection pipeline with **<u>d</u>**ifferential **<u>r</u>**ibosomal protein **<u>i</u>**ncorporation **<u>p</u>**redictions

## Installation
In R (>= 2.10) enviroment

	install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	install_github("fallerlab/ARF")

### Required R libraries
First, make sure that you have the following programs installed:

* bedr
* DESeq2 (>= 1.30.1)
* clusterProfiler
* ComplexHeatmap
* enrichplot
* fgsea
* grid
* ggplot2

## How to use?

### dripARF

To be able to use the ARF package, you first need to align your adapter-trimmed reads to given rRNA sequences (under rRNAs/ folder). After generating the indexed .bam files, we also suggest to perform your positional rRNA abundance quantifications, prior to drip ARF, using the bedtools software. Note that this is not mandatory since you can also use your .bam files as input, however, it will increase the run-time. Following is the example on how you can create your .bedGraph files.

    bedtools genomecov -bg -ibam /your/bam/file.bam >  /your/bedGraph/file.bedGraph

dripARFs input is a tab-seperated samples file which contains the path to your rRNA read alignments (see samples.tsv as an example).
