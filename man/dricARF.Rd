\arguments{
\item{samplesFile}{File that describes file locations and sample groupings}

\item{rRNAs_fasta}{Fasta file for the 4 rRNAs of the organism.}

\item{organism}{Organism abbrevation. Pass "hs" for human, "mm" for mouse, and "sc" for yeast.}

\item{compare}{If you want to compare samples based on other grouping, choose the columnname that is given in samplesFile (Default=group).}

\item{QCplot}{TRUE or FALSE, whether to generate QC plots or not.}

\item{targetDir}{Directory to save the QC plots in.}

\item{comparisons}{List of comparisons to be included.}

\item{exclude}{List of sample names to be excluded from the analysis.}

\item{GSEAplots}{Whether to produce and save the standard GSEA plots.}

\item{samples}{Samples dataframe created by read_ARF_samples_file() function.}

\item{gsea_sets_RP}{RP-rRNA contact point sets to perform enrichments on.}

\item{RP_proximity_df}{RP-rRNA proximity matrix that is calculated by ARF.}
